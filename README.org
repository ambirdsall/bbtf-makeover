#+TITLE: BBTF Makeover

So, Baseball Think Factory is a wonderful site. Scratch that: it's an adequate, slightly ugly,
old-fashioned site with some wonderful discussions. This is a chrome extension that improves the
former so you can enjoy the latter with a little less eye strain.

It's not intended to be an ambitious, wholesale redesign (though if you're into that sort of thing,
pull requests are certainly welcome); the initial motivation was honestly just injecting
`line-height: 1.4;` into the stylesheet.

Licensed under the WTFPL. Do whatever the fuck you want with it.
